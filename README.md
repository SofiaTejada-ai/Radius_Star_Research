Radius_Star_Research – Neutron Star Analysis Tool
This project focuses on analyzing neutron stars through an interactive Python-based interface, integrating scientific computation and data visualization. Built using NumPy, Matplotlib, Flask, Tkinter, and SciPy, the program allows users to input numerical data and generate interactive graphs displaying key properties of neutron stars, including pressure, mass, and energy density. It also supports importing external data files, enhancing its usability for scientific research.

The front-end incorporates HTML with decorative elements to ensure a visually appealing and seamless user experience. Robust input validation was implemented to handle errors gracefully, making the application more user-friendly and reliable.

To ensure scientific accuracy, in-depth research on neutron star physics was conducted using academic papers provided by a professor. This research informed the computational modeling and data analysis features of the project.

This project was successfully presented at the university’s Research Symposium, where it received positive feedback for its innovative approach and execution.
